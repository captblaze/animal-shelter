        <div class="col"><h3><strong>This fun Labrador pup won over our hearts when he appeared in the heartwarming 2008 film, Marley and Me, alongside Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson.
        "Labradors are loving and full of personality, intelligent and eager to please," Bill Lambert from the Kennel Club tells Country Living. "As their name suggests, they have keen retrieving skills and were originally trained and bred for this purpose. Today, Labradors are incredibly versatile; whilst still widely used for their original purpose, they are also just as suited to being a four-legged family companion as they are to working as a guide or assistance dog.</strong></h3></div><br>

        <div class="col">
            <h3><strong>This famous St. Bernard pup from the much-loved 1992 film was named after the composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. This breed was chosen for the film because they are incredibly trustworthy, kind-hearted and intelligent dogs. "St. Bernards have been used for rescue work, locating lost and stranded travellers in their native Switzerland. Working breeds, like the St Bernard, aid humans in many ways and tend to be specialists in their field, who excel in their line of work," Bill tells us.</strong></h3></div>

        <div class="col">
            <h3><strong>Elle Wood's much-loved pet Chihuahua, Bruiser, is one of the most famous dogs in Hollywood. Alert and spirited, these dogs are brimming with personality. "They were bred to be companion dogs so they love attention," Bill says. As well as accompanying Elle at Harvard, Bruiser provides some brilliant entertainment throughout the film. And is also full of personality, much like his owner.</strong></h3>
